headword: droplet
definition: A droplet is a self-deployable container image that contains a compiled application package along with its runtime and all the dependencies required by the application and runtime to perform. When an application is pushed using "cf push" command, a droplet is generated for that application to run independently in its own container inside a Diago Cell. The generated droplet then stored in a blobstore for future use. This stored droplet would be used when the application needs to scale out or just restarted to save time of generating the droplet from the scratch. It is worth to note that "cf push" command creates a droplet, "cf restart" command uses an existing droplet for the application, and, "cf restage" command regenerates the droplet.
