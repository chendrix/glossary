definition: >
  Steeltoe is an open source project originally built to allow .NET applications to leverage 
  Spring Cloud Services, and many Cloud Foundry tools, services, and conventions in a simple way. 
  Steeltoe contains Connectors for common backing services, Actuators to expose application health and 
  other troubleshooting information, Security Providers (for UAA and SSO), as well as .NET clients for
  Eureka, Spring Cloud Config Server, and Hystrix. It's primarily built and maintained by Pivotal but is 
  part of the open source .NET Foundation.
