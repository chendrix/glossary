  The Service Broker API defines an HTTP interface between the services
  marketplace of a platform and service brokers.  The service broker is the
  component of the service that implements the Service Broker API, for which a
  platform's marketplace is a client.  Service brokers are responsible for
  advertising a catalog of service offerings and service plans to the
  marketplace, and acting on requests from the marketplace for provisioning,
  binding, unbinding, and deprovisioning.

  If you look at the Pivotal Application Service Apps Manager interface you will
  see some of the services listed like ElephantSQL - PostgreSQL service
  which is a service broker representing the service ElephantSQL for the Platform.
