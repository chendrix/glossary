expansion: Client Liaison
definition: >
  The Client Liaison is a role whose primary responsibility is managing the relationship between Pivotal and the Client during a services engagement. 
  In Pivotal Labs, this role is often fulfilled by someone with the OD or AD title. Managing expectations, surfacing risk early, and understanding the 
  evolving needs and requirements of long-running projects also come into play for the CL. CL is also sometimes used as an adjective to describe the 
  meeting between the person acting in the Client Liaison role on a project, team leaders such as the Anchor, and leadership from the Client side.
