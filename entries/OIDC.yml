definition: >
  OpenID Connect is a set of standards designed to solve the problem of
  delegated identity. Using OpenID Connect, applications acting as OIDC Relying
  Parties may receive a JWT-encoded identity token from an Identity Provider
  that contains user information such as username, email address, first and last
  names, and other configurable attributes. Within Cloud Foundry, the UAA
  component can be configured to act as an OIDC Identity Provider or proxy user
  information from OIDC Identity Providers external to the platform.
