expansion: F5 BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager load balancer
definition: >
  F5 (the company) was originally known just for their load balancing product. 
  Today they have a whole suite of products and services around load balancing/acceleration, 
  traffic shaping, firewalls, security etc.

  However, in the Pivotal world, we mostly know them for their load balancer that is often used in front of 
  the gorouters as an entry point to Pivotal Cloud Foundry when deployed on a private cloud such as vSphere.
