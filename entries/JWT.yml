headword: JWT
expansion: JSON Web Token
definition: >
  JWT is an encoding format used to represent OAuth2 access tokens and refresh
  tokens, and OIDC identity tokens. A JWT format token has three
  period-delimited segments that represent the base64 encoding of JSON payloads
  representing a token header, body, and digital signature. Within Cloud
  Foundry, every JWT token issued by the UAA is digitally signed and may be
  validated offline by other components when they receive the token as part of
  an API call.
