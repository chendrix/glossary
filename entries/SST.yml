  A tool developed by Dell EMC which is intended to test a vSphere cluster to ensure that all 
  network paths are fully functional, that network resources (like NTP & DNS servers) are 
  reachable, and that storage is fully accessible, etc. Delivered as an VMDK image that 
  presents a web interface once booted; after all the vCenter information is entered a test 
  VM is deployed to every single physical host in the cluster, and communication paths are 
  tested between every test VM, and every other test VM.
