expansion: Isolation Segment Tile
definition: >
  The Isolation Segment tile deploys compute and/or routing resouces of the
  Pivotal Application Service (PAS), without the control plane.  It offers
  Compute Isolation and Routing Isolation. And these features are not mutually
  exclusive. Operators can mix and match them to fit their needs.  The
  mechanism for Compute Isolation is the deployment of Diego cells earmarked
  for this purpose. The Isolation Segments tile deploys a user-specified number
  of Diego cells that will connect to, and receive workloads from, the shared
  Elastic Runtime control-plane.  For Routing Isolation, the tile offers a set
  of dedicated routers. These routers can be configured with their own TLS
  certificates. And they can be attached to their own load balancer, which
  allows inbound traffic to be completely isolated at the routing tier.
