definition: >
  OAuth2 is a standard designed to solve the problem of delegated authorization.
  It is used when an application, called a Client, wants to perform some action
  in another application, called a Resource Server, on behalf of a user. By
  implementing one of the procedures defined in the OAuth2 specification, Clients
  may receive an access token that represents the permissions the user has
  consented to delegate to the Client. The Client passes the token to the
  Resource Server when making API calls on a user's behalf.  Resource Servers
  validate the access token to ensure required permissions are present before
  completing API requests.
